## My Journey

> "Creativity is, by definition, the ability to create. So create opportunity. Ignore your detractors, overcome your own doubt. Risk failure, risk humiliation, risk your pride and go confidently in the direction of your aspirations. Your determination is your permission to revel in your success."
>
> — Kevin Mesiab, CEO, EasyAd LLC (2007)

### The Start
My humble journey began with undergraduate studies at Boise State University majoring in Marketing and Economics before later switching to Computer Science. I left school early when I was headhunted by Hewlett Packard and spent two years in the commercial MFP R&D labs. I later co-founded Wilder Technologies with two former HP employees, a company focused on commercial printer fleet management software.

### The Evolution
After selling our flagship product, I founded EasyAd Marketing at the age of 26. I led the company to market leadership and profitability within six months, generating over $1.6 million in revenue before its eventual dissolution following a protracted legal challenge from Craigslist Inc. The journey was invaluable.

### The Hat Trick
I then established Mesiab Labs LLC, a Social Media Marketing software company based on the North Shore of Oahu. Our portfolio, most notably Hummingbird for Twitter and the acclaimed Retweet.com, has left an indelible mark on the industry, culminating in a record-setting sale.

### The Maturity
Later I co-founded Jounce, Inc., where I secured Series A funding in 2011. As Chairman of the Board and CTO, I designed and developed our core product, before divesting in 2014 to return to my roots. Currently, the brilliant team is at the forefront of reshaping performance-based marketing, making waves at [Instapage](http://instapage.com).
