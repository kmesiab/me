# Kevin Mesiab - Senior Full Stack Developer 👨‍💻🚀

Hello there, fellow coders, thinkers, and digital wanderers! Welcome to my personal GitHub page, a humble corner of the internet where code meets creativity. I'm Kevin, your friendly neighborhood developer with a knack for turning redbull into binary. ☕💻

## About Me

With roots in Boise State University and a journey through the realms of Marketing and Economics, I found my true calling in Computer Science. 🌐📚 My academic adventures led me from being headhunted by Hewlett Packard to co-founding Wilder Technologies, and then diving head-first into the software startup arena with EasyAd Marketing Software Corp. 🚀

As a CEO, Managing Director, and Chief Techie, I've navigated the turbulent waters of the tech world, leaving a trail of innovative projects and happy clients. Currently, I'm wielding my coding powers at McGraw-Hill, where we're reshaping the future of education. 📚✨

## What I Do

As a Senior Full Stack Developer, I juggle a plethora of technologies and frameworks:

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Go, PHP, python, and a pinch of TypeScript for flavor, among others. 🌐
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS aficionado, crafting cloud architectures and sipping on serverless solutions. ☁️
- **Web Development:** From spinning up web services to polishing frontend designs. 🖥️

## Projects and Musings

- **AI Code Critic:** An AI-powered desktop app automating code reviews across various languages. 🤖
- **GoAudibly:** A Golang-based transcription pipeline, watching folders and transcribing audio files like a pro. 🎧

## Beyond the Code

- **Life Philosophy:** If you've got tight boots, always have extra lace to lend. 👢🌟
